NOTE: This is known to works only on Linux and MacOS environments

ruby-cucumber is a vim plugin for cucumber files. Basically it has 3 main functionalities

(1). Jump to a step defintion from a feature file
(2). Auto completion (Omni) when typing a step
(3). highlight undefined steps on save.

you need +ruby support for (1) and (2) and +signs support for (3)
you need grep from command line

By default:

(1). For jumping, There is only one sample map in .vim/ftplugin/cucumber.vim

<C-W><C-]> to open the step defintion in new tab

define your keymap as you will using VIMCucumber.jump_step function. for example:

Ctrl+s for split window would be defined as:

nmap <silent><buffer> <C-s>  :ruby VIMCucumber.jump_step('split')<CR>


(2). Auto completion use Omnifunc so the default is, in insert mode,

<C-x><C-o> will display all the step matched the text. Matching is case insensitive and order insensitive so the follwing textes will bring up the same steps

we will
will we
We will
Will wE

(3). highlight undefined steps on save. This is doned by define a sign and when the buffer is first read and any following save, a function is called to check all the steps on that file. Very basic implementation, it does'nt check if the line does'nt start with Given, Then, And, When, or But. Also, whenever a .rb file is save a funtion is called to refresh the cached steps definitions.

As the plugin utilise system grep to fetch all the steps defintion and parse the output, this might not work on Window.
Any patch is welcomed.
